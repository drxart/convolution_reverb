Convolution reverb is an exciting technique of bringing new space into the sounds. The
program built in Python 3 digitally simulates the reverberation of a physical or virtual acoustic
space with the help of a program. It convolves an input signal with the impulse response of an
actual or a virtual acoustic space creating an illusion as if the input signal was recorded in that
acoustic space. The output audio signal reflects the sonic qualities of the selected acoustic
environment. This technique is widely used in Electronic Music, Machine Simulation and Real
Space Simulations.
